# What is it

  ðŸ”¥ A blazingly fast slug creator. Create text that is easily read by humans and is url friendly.
  Typical use case would be to refer to resources by their name.  
  This can help both your users and search engines to categorize your exposed resources.

Example slugs

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| text.contains.!marks#: | textcontainsmarks |
| Hello KÃ¸nnÃ¬chiwa | hello-konnichiwa |
| some--LONG_space-- | some-long_space- |
| ðŸ‘‘ ðŸŒ´ | crown-palm_tree |
| ÐŸÑ€Ð¸Ð²ÐµÑ‚ | privet |


Behind the scenes, this uses the package `AnyAscii` slugger, which also transliterates.

By default FastSlugger will do the following:
- [x] use (`-`) dashes to `separate-words`
- [x] truncate any consecutive dashes to a single dash
- [x] make all characters lowercase
- [x] remove any punctuation, such as `!`, `/`, `#` or `.`
- [x] convert any connector punctuation such as `â€¿` to `_`.
- [x] truncate any consecutive connector punctuation to a single underscore `_`


# Installation

`dotnet add package FastSlugger`

# Usage

```csharp
using FastSlugger;

var text = "Create a new slug! FrÃ¸m Ã¨nglish#---txt";

// Output: "create-a-new-slug-from-english-txt"
var slug = Slug.Create(text);
```

You can configure the slugger by overriding the default parameter values for the connector character, the separator character and how long the slug should maximally be.

# Options

The `Slug.Create` method takes 4 optional parameters that can configure the generated slug.

```csharp
// Signature:
string Create(string input, char connector, char separator, char? punctuation, int? max);
```

These are:
- `connector` - which changes the character used for underscore. Default value is `_`
- `separator` - which changes the character used for spaces. Default value is `-`
- `punctuation` - which changes the character used for punctuations. Default value is removal of the character
- `max` - defines the maximum length of the slug. The slug can be smaller than the max value. Default is unlimited length


# Remarks
This library uses stack allocation if the slug length is less than 1000 characters, which can be seen by the benchmark result.

The AnyAscii library seems to be a huge custom lookup table.

Furthermore the string creation uses the high performance community toolkit library to minimize string allocation.
